## Abstract

A monte carlo tree search (mcts) based algorithm will be adopted in this assignment. One
of the most significant reasons is that there will be only 10 seconds for each player to make
a move in the game. Therefore, the property of monte carlo tree search is appreciated
since it can be terminated anytime. Another issue is that, however, 10 seconds are rather
limited for monte carlo based algorithm to approach a precise solution. To tackle this
challenge, a heuristic function is introduced to do pruning and avoid blunders.
